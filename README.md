Due to constantly working on screen and on mobile phones these days, our eyes get strained a lot. As a result of this we blink our eyes too many times due to dryness and sometimes our eyes get watery / red due to strain. Thiis is an application that monitors your eye blinking pattern and the colour/ state of your eye and alerts you if it finds anything abnormal. It also keeps track of your distance from the screen and warns you if you are too close to the screen for a longer duration.

We are also planning to extend it to capture the posture of the shoulders and head to determine and alert the person if it's wrong.

This can also be implemented in vehciles for drowsy drivers too. As per statistics, 21% of accidents in India are due to droswy drivers. This application can be extended to warn the drivers in the vehcile if they close their eye for longer duration and/or are blinking their eyes too many times/ red eyes etc.
